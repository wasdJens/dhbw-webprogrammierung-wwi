# README

When trying to run these examples with nodejs you may need to comment some line of codes from the files since many variables are declared as duplicates. 

The easiest way to test the snippets is to simply copy paste parts into your browser console. 

# Folder structure 

* `variables.js` includes the first introduction samples about how to define variables in javascript
* `types.js` includes snippets on how to work with datatypes in javascript and how to create objects 
* `logicaloperators.js` includes snippets about value comparison and boolean operators 

# Browser examples

Browser sample code snippets

```javascript
// Create a new variable "a" and save "Hello World" as value
const a = "Hello World"

// Print the variable a in the console
console.log(a) // => Hello World
```

```javascript
// Create a variable with value 25
const number1 = 25;
// Create a variable with value 25
const numer2 = 100;

// Create another variable which holds the result of number1 * number 2
const res = number1 * number2;

// Print the result in the console
console.log(res) // => 2500
```
